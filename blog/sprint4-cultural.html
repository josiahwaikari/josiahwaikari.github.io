            <span class="meta-user">by <a class="name" href="https://github.com/josiahwaikari" target="_blank">josiah waikari</a> â€¢ 17 july 2020</span>
            
            <h2>How understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</h2>
            <p>
                By being able to rewire your brain, if one part of the brain becomes damaged we can get other areas to take over the traffic. we are able to recover from brain events like strokes, traumatic brain injuries. Losing one function may enhance other functions. If one sense gets lost like sight, smell might be heightened. Enhanced memory abilities. Better cognitive function. Effective learning.
            </p>

            <h2>How I will engage with the principals of neuroplasticity for my own benefit</h2>
            <p>
                I will most likely engage in principals of neuroplasticity so I can improve my memory, cognitive abilities and learning efficiency. I would like to be able to learn much more efficiently and be able to store a lot more information in my brain.
            </p>

            <h2>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        By getting an adequate amount of sleep allows your brain to reset connections that are important for memory and learning.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Process of learning something improves neuroplasticity. Practicing and learning a new language for examples has found to strengthen the brain.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Exercising is also beneficial for the brain, cardiovascular exercises boost oxygen supply to the brain and increases brain volume.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Reduce stress because it diminishes neuroplasticity.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        If you focus and have motivation, if you have a good reason for learning then you will try harder and focus more on the task thus enhancing neuroplasticity
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Reading a fiction novel also increases brain connectivity.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What growth mindset is and why it is relevant</h2>
            <p>
                People with a growth mindset believe their abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work. a growth mindset can help you recover from illness because you believe that you can do something about the illness. They can help you achieve in sport, at work and can also help you grow and develop in relationships.
            </p>

            <h2>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h2>
            <p>
                I will seek critical feedback and a challenge with a can do attitude. I will always put in 100% effort and be dedicated to the current problem.
