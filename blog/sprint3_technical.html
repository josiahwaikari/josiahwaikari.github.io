            <h2>This is my technical blog for week 3</h2>
            <span class="meta-user">by <a class="name" href="https://github.com/josiahwaikari" target="_blank">josiah waikari</a> • 11 july 2020</span>
         
            <h2>HTML & CSS Difference</h2>
            <p>You can think of HTML like the physical construct of walls, floors, windows, doors which make up the structural component of your home and you can think of CSS as the decoration and presentation of your house so that includes the paint[outside, inside], carpet[colour, texture], how tall the roof from the ground is, hallway width, frame widths and so fourth. It allows us to structure and present our product however we may please with HTML being the structure and CSS being the presentation aspect.</p>

            <h2>Control Flow & Loops Explained</h2>
            <p>Control flow is the chronological order in which things occur, let's say you have a routine where you brush your teeth, then you floss, then you mouthwash and rinse. These are the steps for basic dental hygiene and the order in which it occurred is what control flow is.</p>
            <p>Loops is just what it sounds like, repetitive, looping and doing something over and over again. We can say it like when you are in school and your teacher told you to write a sentence or word on a piece of paper 100 times, this is what a loop is. We are just doing something x amount of times until a condition is met, which in this case is when you’ve completed writing the word 100 times and the loop exits.</p>

            <h2>What Is The DOM?</h2>
            <p>The DOM is a data representation of the elements in a given document, it represents the structure and content as objects. We can think of it in a tree structure (DOM Tree) and each element in that tree or leaf is called a node. We can use these nodes to access certain properties and capabilities, we use javascript to access them and use them to do cool things.</p>

            <h2>The Difference Between Accessing Data From Arrays And Objects</h2>
            <p>With arrays we use indexing to access elements inside of an array and the square bracket notation.</p>
            <pre><code>let array = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
array[1] // returns the second element in the array since we always start with 0 when counting in javascript</code></pre>
            <p>Objects we use the object name and then we specify using the dot or bracket notation the property in which we would like to access:</p>
                <pre><code>let user =  {
    name: “John”,
    age: 23
}

user.name // this returns John and we are using the dot notation
user[“name”] // this returns John too but we are using bracket notation instead which is similar to arrays but instead we reference names</code></pre>
            
            <h2>Functions are useful!</h2>
            <p>Functions are just a task which we predefined once and we can call this predefined code as many times as we need. It allows us to reuse code instead of repeating ourselves over and over making our code cluttered.</p>
