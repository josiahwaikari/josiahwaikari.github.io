            <h2>My long term goals and career pathway</h2>
            <p>My long term goals since I was a kid was to become a billionaire, I think naturally it was a goal of all of ours to be rich and be able to afford everything and anything. I have always had big ideas and dreams that spanned deeper into the future. I am wanting to create multiple tech companies one day which would aid making the future better. I probably will work as a web developer for a bit and in unison create another source of income and also create one of my projects that I have in my head so I can potentially fund my other future projects and get me a few steps closer to my goal.</p>
            
            <h2>A human skill that I would like to see developed</h2>
            <p>I have always struggled when it comes to communication with others. You would seldom see me engaging in conversation with people, to the point where I don’t actually talk. 
                I'm not sure whether this is partly due to me travelling around while being home schooled for the last 5 years and I pretty much kept to myself or just actually a shy dude.
                I would definitely like to change this mindset and develop stronger communication skills and also have the ability to relate with other people. I know how important communication is required to work with a colleague or within a team environment.
                I realise that I need to improve my outlook in this area and seek early intervention on my best options so I can work towards a productive future.</p>
            
            <h2>My strengths</h2>
            <p>Strengths would be determination, ambition, creative and dedicated. I love building things slightly out of my current range of competence because I love the feeling of working on difficult challenges and finishing them. I like to push myself to go outside my normal boundaries and accomplish what I thought was impossible a week, a month, or a year before finishing that project. So, I'm constantly chasing something bigger, something brighter, something greater every single day. I'm always trying to improve myself and be the best I can be.</p>

            <h2>My limitations</h2>
            <p>I think a limitation for me is the difficulty to ask questions. I'm naturally shy and think I can solve any problems on my own. Not always the case. I usually stumble upon something I can't do, and find it is way beyond my control and me not being able to ask for help, really sets me back and restricts my true potential.</p>

            <h2>How I will manage my workload</h2>
            <p>I have never been someone who is good with time management, scheduling, or keeping on track with a specific task so managing my workload the past week or so has been a very difficult task. This is why I have started implementing the pomodoro technique which allows me to work in little bursts of 30 minutes while having breaks in-between which has drastically improved my focus as well as my progress on assigned work. I have also been following the timebox suggestions which allows me to manage the time I have for a specific task which really helps me to move along to the next ones without staying behind and perfecting, which is usually what I tend to do. Next step for me is to create a schedule on what I am going to do that day and follow it.</p>

            <h2>My commitment how and where I will seek help</h2>
            <p>I usually find it super difficult to ask questions, however, I have been asking a few questions to my facilitator and he has been kind enough to give me helpful information that will significantly improve the way I learn and continue on through this course.</p>

            <h2>What I expect from the facilitation team</h2>
            <p>I expect support and structure and ways or tips on how to do something effectively and/or feedback</p>

            <h2>Any schedule interruptions?</h2>
            <p>I am available to study 8 -10 hours a day but I don't have a schedule right now but hopefully at the time you are reading this, it's all changed and I hopefully have improved by abiding by one.</p>
