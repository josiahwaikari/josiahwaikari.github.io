            <h1>A simple problem</h1>
            <p>
                I was following the pseudocode I had written up for a particular kata and I stumbled across a point I just couldn't figure out so I talked to the rubber ducky to figure out the next step and then I googled and searched tirelessly on stack overflow and other code forums. I found the methods that were required to achieve the problem that I was having and I tried it in multiple ways with different conditions before actually getting it right and I knew I had the right data by console logging it. Problem solved :)

                        Pseudocode<br>It's extremely helpful when you have larger projects and you can explain it how you think about it which should give you a foundation in which you could write your code around it.

                    <p>
                        Trying Something<br>I rarely try something and then try something. I usually have what I want to do, how I am going to do it and what tools to use for that specific problem.

                        Rubber ducky method<br>I would have never thought talking to a rubber duck about your problem would actually help but it did and I found myself explaining the rest of what was hidden and solved the problem afterwards.

                        Reading Error Messages<br>I found reading error messages pointed me directly to the problem, it provided me with a lot of information when it came to debugging.
                    </p>
                </li>

                    <p>
                        Console Logging<br>Logging to the console is my personal favourite, I use it to print the data being passed as arguments to a function to see what I am working with which gives me a rough idea of how I can manipulate it. I also use it to print out data or steps as I write my code just so I can see that the code that I am manipulating is actually doing what I specified and the desired results are produced.

                        Googling<br>I found myself googling around a few times for a few syntax issues and new methods to implement on my code. Very helpful. Google is a new friend!
