            <h1>Emotional Intelligence and IQ</h1>
            <h2>Emotional intelligence is the ability to monitor one's own and other's feelings and emotions, to differentiate between them and to use the information to guide one's thinking and actions</h2>

            <h2>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
            <p>Emotional intelligence is the ability to understand, use and manage your own emotions in positive ways to do things like managing stress, communicating effectively, emphasising with others, overcoming challenges. It helps you build stronger relationships, succeed at work or school and helps achieve career and personal goals. Emotional intelligence can also help you connect with your feelings.</p>
            <p>Emotional intelligence is commonly defined by four attributes:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>Self-management – You’re able to control impulsive feelings and behaviours, manage your emotions in healthy ways, take initiative, follow through on commitments, and adapt to changing circumstances.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Self-awareness – You recognize your own emotions and how they affect your thoughts and behaviour. You know your strengths and weaknesses, and have self-confidence.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Social awareness – You have empathy. You can understand the emotions, needs, and concerns of other people, pick up on emotional cues, feel comfortable socially, and recognize the power dynamics in a group or organization.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Relationship management – You know how to develop and maintain good relationships, communicate clearly, inspire and influence others, work well in a team, and manage conflict.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            
            <h2>How is it different to IQ?</h2>
            <p>IQ is primarily used to measure one’s cognitive abilities, such as the ability to learn or understand new situations; how to reason through a given problem/scenario; the ability to apply knowledge to one’s current situations. It's all about the logical side of thinking instead of using your emotional side however when IQ and EQ is cohesively applied, outcomes are far greater than without EQ.</p>
           
            <h2>Why is it important?</h2>
            <p>It's important because you are able to learn how to control your emotions including stress which if not controlled can turn into severe physical and health problems. It also helps in a workplace environment when working cohesively with a team since it allows you to understand others, communicate effectively with others and it allows you to guide your behaviour.</p>
