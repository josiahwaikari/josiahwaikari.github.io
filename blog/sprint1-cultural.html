            <h1>Identity, Values and Strengths</h1>

            <h2>My strengths and limitations</h2>
            <p>Strengths would be determination, ambition, creative and dedicated. I love building things slightly out of my current range of competence because I love the feeling of working on difficult challenges and finishing them. I like to push myself to go outside my normal boundaries and accomplish what I thought was impossible a week, a month, or a year before finishing that project. So, I'm constantly chasing something bigger, something brighter, something greater every single day. I'm always trying to improve myself and be the best I can be. I think this will really help me thrive when learning.</p>
            <p>I think a limitation for me is the difficulty to ask questions. I'm naturally shy and think I can solve any problems on my own. Not always the case. I usually stumble upon something I can't do, and find it is way beyond my control and me not being able to ask for help, really sets me back and restricts my true potential.</p>

            <h2>How my culture has influenced my values and identity</h2>
            <p>I value those close to me more than anything. Growing up with a large family and being the youngest of seven has had its advantages I suppose. I was spoilt rotten by all my five older sisters and older bro. They treated me like I was their baby and got almost anything I wanted, not that I asked for anything. The only disadvantage was that as I grew older I used to hate being smothered in kisses and cuddles by them especially when they would drop me off at school. I was brought up by my mum and she always taught us the importance of respect and keeping Whanau close. I grew up around my nephews and nieces living with us all the time which sometimes felt like a marae in our house at times with mattresses everywhere.</p>
            <p>My Mum and Dad are both of Maori decent and I have been to numerous whanau reunions back up the East Coast where I have met many of my extended whanau whom attended these events. These times had taught me about the importance of Whanau and shown me where my tipuna (ancestors) grew up and the importance of tikanga (customs and traditional values). It was here we were taught about the importance of different aspects of our culture, in particular our whakapapa (genealogy) and the traditional protocols surrounding being on a Marae (Meeting House). How to act when on or around the Urupa (burial site). We also learnt about how our tipuna gathered kai (food).</p>
