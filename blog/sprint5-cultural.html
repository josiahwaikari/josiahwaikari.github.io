            <h2>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                   <p>
                        I have learnt that I do value things, I always thought I was an unemotional person and fully logical but recently I have noticed a change in how I act and think. I am becoming emotional, I am becoming human.
                   </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        I learn that I am able to change my perspective on things and how my brain adapts to certain situations.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        I learnt that I am more calmer and relaxed after I have participated in mindfulness meditation.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</h2>
            <p>
                Coders need to be able to work with, and explain what they do to employers, clients, consumers and co-workers that don’t understand what they do. Writing clean, effective code is great, but when you pair it with strong empathy and communication skills you get good results. I think being able to be self aware of what you are doing will heavily influence the outcome of what you are wanting because you are aware of what you can do and cant do and how far you can go.
            </p>

            <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
            <p>
                Probably how much it has helped and influenced my learning in general like I am able to apply core techniques as well as thoughts to better understand the material I am trying to grasp.
            </p>

            <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
            <p>
                I think for me the most challenging aspects of the core learning was actually talking to somebody as well as listening because I have never been somebody to talk to and who talks. I'm super unsociable so the majority of the core learning were difficult.
            </p>

            <h2>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h2>
            <p>
                I think you are doing it because the tech industry look more for core skills and how well you communicate and interact with other people rather than your technical capabilities so I think you are training that side of us to be prepared for a new environment as well as giving us a higher possibility of getting a job.
            </p>

            <h2>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead?</h2>
            <p>
                I feel it could be a bit more engaging, I think maybe incorporate challenges or little tasks to complete to actually put the core skills you are learning to use. Forcing us to create habits. I don't think it's a waste of time but preferably id rather do the technical side of things because it seems more fun.

            <h1>Learning Journey</h1>

            <h2>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h2>
            <p>
                I want to get the technical skills out of doing this course so I am able to build some of my projects that I have banked in my mind but that's not my full goal because I know valuing money and chasing it will only leave me depressed so I will create some things and make enough money to travel, live life and be happy with my person. Happiness is key to a good life.
            </p>

            <h2>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h2>
            <p>
                I think my strengths and limitations haven't changed, I still believe my determination and ambition mixed with my creativity and dedication will be able to take me a long way but my limitation being shy and lesser in communication will definitely hinder me behind a bit.
            </p>

            <h2>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h2>
            <p>
                I think communicating with others and working in groups is going to be very challenging for me, anything with people is a challenge but I am willing to do anything to overcome that.
            </p>

            <h2>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h2>
            <p>
                I really would like to improve myself and become a better person, I want to strip my limitations and make them my strengths. I want to work on communication, team work and anything to do with people. I am not a people person but I really would like to try and make changes so I am able to do that.
            </p>

            <h2>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?</h2>
            <p>
                I expect myself to work productively and on track all of the time,  I don't want to get off track and will have to catch up on time. I expect the best, nothing less of myself because higher thoughts highly influences the outcome. I will seek help when I come across something I can't achieve myself, I am very independent so I will try my best before outsourcing which can be a problem sometimes. I am dedicated and ready to put in the time and effort to pump this bootcamp out and get the skills and most out of the experience I came here for.
